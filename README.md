## Correlation Between COVID Cases and Vaccination Status Among Different Age Groups in the U.S. 


COVID-19 vaccinations in the U.S. first became available to select populations, such as the elderly and immunocompromised, back in June 2020, right after COVID-19 broke out in March. Fast forward to present day where vaccinations are available to everyone, along with the development of a booster shot. However, vaccines have become very controversial because little is known about the vaccines. 

The COVID-19 vaccines were the fastest vaccines to get approved for use. This has led to many people wondering, just how effective are these vaccines?

In this project, we will be doing an exploratory data analysis on the relationship between the number of COVID-19 cases and the number of people vaccinated. This will help to show the effectiveness of the vaccine. 

We will be using data from the EDA to look for relationships between positive COVID-19 cases and vaccination status among different age groups. We will be looking at the whole population of the U.S. to get more accurate information on the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine. If the vaccine is effective, we will see that as the number of vaccinated people goes up, the amount of COVID-19 cases will go down.
